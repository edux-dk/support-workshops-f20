title: Support Workshops for Digital Literacy and Curriculum F20
place: online
time: Oct 23, Oct. 30, Nov. 12, Nov. 19, Dec. 4
instructors: K.G. Kjelmannm, R.D. Kristensen-McLachlan, M. Jacomy, & K.L. Nielbo
```

`Support Workshops` are optional hands-on introductions to a technical topic (e.g., data wrangling, web-scraping, machine learning) offered exclusively to course participants on [Digital Literacy](https://dighumlab.org/dl/) and [Digital Curriculum](https://dighumlab.org/dc/). Participation is _optional_ and there is no sign-up, just drop, when a workshop begins. Every workshop requires approximately one hour preparation (see below), but `tech support` offers a pre-workshop preparation _one hour before each workshop_ (e.g., a workshop that starts at 09:00 AM, will offer online pre-workshop preparation at 08:00 AM using the same Zoom room). Zoom links are distributed through Slack and mailing list for participants. For questions, please contact [M. Andesen](mailto:m.andersen@au.dk?subject=[DL2]%20Support%20Workshops%20F20).

As several of the instructors are are trained Software and Data Carpenters, we re-use material from [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/)' workshop curricula and, to a lesser extend [CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.org/)'s lesson material.

`Support Workshops` will continue in S21, if you have any requests for content or suggestions please write [K.L. Nielbo](mailto:kln@cas.au.dk?subject=[DL2]%20Support%20Workshops%20F20). Planned topics for S21 are _Machine Learning with Python #2_ and _Reproducible Coding with Python_.

*) To accommodate _R_ users, `tech support` will provide parallel scripts in _R_.

### Managing Data with OpenRefine ###

A part of the data workflow is preparing the data for analysis. Some of this involves data cleaning, where errors in the data are identified and corrected or formatting made consistent. This step must be taken with the same care and attention to reproducibility as the analysis. OpenRefine is a powerful free and open source tool for working with messy data: cleaning it and transforming it from one format into another.

This lesson will teach you to use OpenRefine to effectively clean and format data and automatically track any changes that you make. Many people comment that this tool saves them literally months of work trying to make these edits by hand.

`Preparation`: install [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/), first [DOWNLOAD](https://openrefine.org/download.html) then follow these installation instructions [INSTALL](https://datacarpentry.org/openrefine-socialsci/setup.html). `Tech support` will provide support for installation of OpenRefine on Oct. 23 08:00-09:00 AM.

The workshop is cloned and modified from [OpenRefine for Social Science Data](https://datacarpentry.org/openrefine-socialsci/).

### Basic Scripting with Python ###

The workshop (consists of two episodes) introduces how researchers can use basic scripting in Python (and R) to manipulate data, automate analysis, and make research pipelines reproducible. To goal is to provide tools that make it easier to get more done with less work, while, at the the same time,facilitate open and reproducible science.

The lessons will teach you how to use variables, data structures, control structures, functions, and error handling in Python. We use [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) to interactively run Python code in the browser.   

`Preparation`: Jupyter is offered in the Cloud by `tech support`, but should you want to install it locally, please download and install the individial [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and [obtain lesson material](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/setup.html) and follow [Option A: Jupyter Notebook](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/setup.html).

### Introduction to Web Scraping and Crawling ###

The workshop introduces to basic internet technology and how to automatically query and extract data available through the internet using [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) and [Hyphe](https://hyphe.medialab.sciences-po.fr/):

### Machine Learning with Python ###

Support _Holiday special_ is an introduction to machine learning with Python (and _R_). Throughout Digital Literacy and Curriculum, we have seen examples of how AI, machine learning and deep learning can accelerate (& automate) research tasks in humanities and social science. Now it is time to get our hands dirty! The workshop focuses on text classification in classical machine learning using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) in Python. At the end, we touch extend the usecase to deep neural networks and image classification.
