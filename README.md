place: online
time: Oct 23, Oct. 30, Nov. 12, Nov. 19, Dec. 4

`Support Workshops` are optional hands-on introductions to a technical topic (e.g., data wrangling, web-scraping, machine learning) offered exclusively to course participants on [Digital Literacy](https://dighumlab.org/dl/) and [Digital Curriculum](https://dighumlab.org/dc/). Participation is _optional_ and there is no sign-up, just drop, when a workshop begins. Every workshop requires approximately one hour preparation (see below), but `tech support` offers a pre-workshop preparation _one hour before each workshop_ (e.g., a workshop that starts at 9:00 AM, will offer online pre-workshop preparation at 8:00 AM using the same Zoom room). Zoom links are distributed through Slack and mailing list for participants. For questions, please contact [M. Andesen](mailto:m.andersen@au.dk?subject=[DL2]%20Support%20Workshops%20F20).

As several of the instructors are are trained Software and Data Carpenters, we re-use material from [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/)' workshop curricula and, to a lesser extend [CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.org/)'s lesson material.

`Support Workshops` will continue in S21, if you have any requests for content or suggestions please write [K.L. Nielbo](mailto:kln@cas.au.dk?subject=[DL2]%20Support%20Workshops%20F20). Planned topics for S21 are _Machine Learning with Python #2_ and _Reproducible Coding with Python_.
